# Break-tests for execution-methodology checkers

TOP 3 SO FAR: (in progress)

## 0. Method

## 1. Script inventory / verification of the list
in progress

## 2. Placement decision (selftest script vs tests/)
in progress

## 3. Per-script real defects found (mutation log)
in progress

## 4. Scripts with NO real case, and why
in progress

## 5. NEW live defects discovered
in progress

## 6. Validation results
in progress

## 0. Method  (UPDATED)
Baseline: execution-methodology `unittest discover` = 1014 tests, OK (skipped=2), 95s.
Mutation harness: patch one line in a checker, re-run only the checker's own test module(s).
If the suite stays GREEN under a mutation that changes real behaviour, that mutation is a
REAL uncovered defect and earns a break-test case. If the suite goes RED, the case is already
covered by unittest and does NOT need a duplicate break-test case.

## 2. Placement decision (DECIDED)
House precedent = `*_selftest.py` SCRIPT beside the checker (progressive-disclosure has exactly
two: push_guard_selftest.py, identifier_guard_selftest.py). Both are hand-runnable, exit 0/1/2.
CRITICAL OBSERVATION (a finding in its own right): `install/verify.sh` runs
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t tests` per skill. It does NOT run the two existing
selftest scripts. So the house precedent's own break-tests are executed by NOTHING automated —
they only run when a human types the command. A break-test nobody runs is the same failure the
doctrine names one layer up ("a guard nobody has watched fail is not evidence of anything").
DECISION: keep the script shape (hand-runnable, matches precedent) AND add a thin
`tests/test_<name>_selftest.py` that subprocess-runs the script and asserts rc==0, so
`unittest discover` — and therefore verify.sh — executes every case.
